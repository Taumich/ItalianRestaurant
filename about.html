            <h3>About:</h3>
            <p>
                we only use fresh and high quality Italian products. The bread we use comes from on of the finest bakeries in Bensonhurst
                , Brooklyn, which has been in business for 30 years. It is delivered to us every morning, right out of the oven,
                still warm, and with its fresh fragrance.

                We only use high quality Italian cold cuts and all the ingredients and condiments are imported directly from Italy,
                like our bufala mozzarella delivered fresh every week.

                We do not make hot paninis and we do not use a press, because by using only fresh bread and the best products
                we want to preserve the quality of the Italian cold cuts being served so that we may offer our customers
                the very best tasting paninis.
